				<h1>The Issue with Queues</h1>
                
				<p>Queues are and have been a staple of organized society for decades, but they have unfortunately failed to advance from simple numbered notes. Long, seemingly unnecessary and tedious queuing in crowded waiting rooms results in a decrease in employee productivity, customer satisfaction and efficiency. This is obviously an issue for all, but those most affected by it are the elderly or people suffering from any type of functional disability, making them feel dependent on others and helpless.
                </p>
				
				<p>Something we all can relate to is that all current queuing-methods are outdated, slow obstacles in our fast-paced world. The issue seems to be that all current queuing systems suffer from the same problem - they are not equipped to handle the flow of people in modern queues. Norwegian emergency rooms have had to face the hardest critique for this issue, and have in recent years tried to implement a color-coding system to categorize people in critical, high-priority and low-priority conditions, but this system still leads to tedious wait times before one can register their issue, and crowded waiting rooms.
                </p>
				
				<div id="main_img"><img src="images/main1.jpg" alt="main1"></div>

				<p>Technology has the ability to be a beautiful assistive tool, given the right implementation. With this mindset, we have come to a solution that will definitively bring the queuing-system into the 21st century. A simple to use, universal and easily implementable digital queuing system that takes the needs of its user into consideration. This system is called QueueDrop, and with the help and cooperation of Norwegian government institutions, we are aiming to revolutionize the daily lives of all Norwegian citizens, for a better tomorrow.

				<h1>QueueDrop Is a Solution!</h1>
				<p>Our innovative solution to this age old problem is to let users request a virtual ticket when they need to use a service. Depending on the queue type, the user might be asked to fill in further details about his case, such as the details of a medical emergency or the department he is queued up for at the DMV. This gives organizations the ability to group users based on the severity or type of their queues, and distribute the waiting times accordingly. In addition, QueueDrop will implement information from sources such as the Norwegian government`s MinID, and Apple and Android`s Health app to gather further information on what the users need might be. Age, gender, physical and mental health will no longer have the chance to be hinders to people, and QueueDrop will give people with special needs the special care they deserve, leveling the playing field for all.</p>

				<p>Our program is extremely simple to use and understand. QueueDrop implements a unified UX on all platforms that presents all of its features in a simple way, making them available to all our users. Voice-control is also available on some devices, allowing users with limited physical function to fully utilize the application by talking to their devices. Similarly, QueueDrop will read out information to the user to aid aging users or users with limited sight. This is done through Apples VoiceOver, or an implemented feature on Android and Windows Phone.
                </p>
                
                <p>In the future, we aim to implement specialized features for certain governmental organizations. For example; say you are elderly and have fallen in your home. QueueDrop gives you the opportunity to register your emergency, and automatically contacts 911 to your case and GPS position to send an ambulance your way. Using this technology, the hospitals ER staff is ready to take you in and the anesthesiologists have already read up on your allergies and pre-existing conditions, saving valuable time.

				<h1>Download QueueDrop</h1>
                
				<p>QueueDrop will be available through a web application with MinID-login, or through a specialised app on devices running iOS, Android or WindowsPhoneOS. The mobile app offers extended functionality, such as real-time notifications and AppleHealth integration. The mobile app is compatible with iOS (iOS 4.0 and up), Android (2.2 Froyo and up) and Windows Phone (7.5 and up) devices.
                </p>
                
				<p>QueueDrop makes login through web-app or mobile app as simple and private as possible by allowing login through BankID or MinID, where the user has the choice of logging in through phone-identification or by using the BankID device provided by their bank. Using these methods, we have made logging in as secure as possible, eliminating the threat of identity theft and privacy violations. If you encounter any issues with downloading or installing the app, or want to help us make QueueDrop better, please contact us at <a href="mailto:queuedrop@example.com?Subject=Hello%20again">queuedrop@example.com</a>.Thank you for making queues better and safer for everyone!
